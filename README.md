# AND101 Project 7 - PokeAPI Part 3: Beautified

Submitted by: **Prachit Sandesh Mhalgi**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Pokedex** is an Android app that serves as a digital encyclopedia for Pokemon species, providing comprehensive information such as types, abilities, and evolutions. It is a must-have tool for Pokemon trainers looking to enhance their knowledge and strategize for battles.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **ü•Ω üêº ü•á**

## Notes

successfully integrated AsyncHTTPClient in my Pokedex app, leveraging RecyclerView to display crucial Pokemon data like name, type, and image in a scrollable list. This implementation not only enhances user interaction by providing a dynamic and organized UI but also demonstrates my proficiency in Android development and efficient API handling.
