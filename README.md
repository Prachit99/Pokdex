# AND101 Project 6 - PokeAPI Part 2: RecyclerView Edition

Submitted by: **Prachit Sandesh Mhalgi**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Pokedex** is an Android app that serves as a digital encyclopedia for Pokemon species, providing comprehensive information such as types, abilities, and evolutions. It is a must-have tool for Pokemon trainers looking to enhance their knowledge and strategize for battles.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **ü•Ω üêº ü•á**

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [X] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [X] Implement a RecyclerView to display a list of entries from the API
- [X] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each RecyclerView item

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [X] Add a UI element for the user to interact with API further
- [X] Show a `Toast` or `Snackbar` when an item is clicked
- [X] Add item dividers with `DividerItemDecoration`


      
## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **Poke API**.

## Notes

I successfully implemented API integration using AsyncHTTPClient in my Pokedex app, displaying three pieces of data for each API entry and allowing users to query specific Pokemon information with a dynamically updated UI, showcasing my skills in Android development and API handling.
