# AND101 Project 5 - PokeAPI

Submitted by: **Prachit Sandesh Mhalgi**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Pokedex** is an Android app that serves as a digital encyclopedia for Pokemon species, providing comprehensive information such as types, abilities, and evolutions. It is a must-have tool for Pokemon trainers looking to enhance their knowledge and strategize for battles.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **ü•Ω üêº ü•á**

## Application Features

<!-- (This is a comment) Please be sure to change the [ ] to [x] for any features you completed.  If a feature is not checked [x], you might miss the points for that item! -->

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [X] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [X] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [X] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [X] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added takes pokemon name as input and makes an API call. It then returns the name, type and abilities of that pokemon. 
- [X] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the app!

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **Poke API**.
